For Module Three of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive we were tasked with developing a MEAN stack application, in groups of three.
Our brief was to create a fully restful MEAN stack web application with authentication and features such as ratings or comments.

At the idea creation stage, we agreed on a concept for our project based on common interests. We decided to create an app for charity, which would aim to address the issue of charity shops receiving bags of items which were of no use to it, i.e. their customers would not be likely to purchase those items, thus making no profit for the charity. Through creating an online platform where charity shops could create their own profiles and communicate which items they had need of (i.e. were in demand by customers), and which items they had enough of, or were unpopular, we could increase the likelihood of charities receiving the items they needed. Additionally, we could enable customers/donors to access this platform and to search for charity shops near them alongside this personalised information.

In the planning stage, we used wire-framing (Balsamiq) and pseudocode to plan out our app. We considered the user experience in each scenario and ensured we were all agreed on the routes and layout of the pages. We additionally mapped out and added each individual task required on Trello, marking these in order of priority i.e. red for critical, orange for preferrable to have, and green for desirable. Only when the planning phase was complete did we move on to the next stage, of development.

At the development stage, I found I was comfortable with setting up the core app, with JavaScript on the back end and Angular on the front end. I encountered some interesting learning points from a technical perspective, some which were easy, some less so. I discovered how to create a back button, which was extremely easy! I also created a delete modal, that appeared whenever the user tried to delete their profile, asking if they were sure they wanted to do it. While this was straightforward enough, it proved tricky to subsequently log the user out of the app. I learned that in order to do so, it was necessary to send a broadcast message from the delete controller on the front end, stating that the user was now logged out, which was then picked up by the main controller, and carried out.

I also learned that accessing the user id can be tricky depending on where you are calling it in the app. I found that you can inject $Auth into the corresponding controller, and use the payload (the jwt token generated upon log-in) to access the user id. I additionally learned how to carry out TDD, testing my code works as you develop it, and found that this really helped me both to focus on the purpose of each part of code, and to have confidence that the code I added to the codebase was completely working.

Additionally, my learning points from a soft skill perspective, were the extent to which communication is key for effective group work! I enjoyed using visual communication tools such as Trello, and consistent updates to each other to ensure we were always working on different tasks, that we were aware of who and what we were dependent on for our task, and to ensure we didn't encounter any tricky merge conflicts, by merging regularly. We also ensured to offer each other support, to note if one person became stuck or stressed, and to talk out the issue with them until they were back on track again. This effective communication meant our group moved along very smoothly and overcame any bumps along the road.

Developing this full stack restful app with my group was a very positive and enjoyable experience, and a true learning experience.
